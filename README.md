### Usage and Contributions

To discuss any of these, please [open an issue](issues), or fork and submit a pull-request.

## Design Patterns
* **Positive feedback**: engage people in re-imagining something for the better (instead of bludgeoning them with data about how much it currently sucks). Make it fun; make it magical. Make it different (in a good way!). Examples: [Blockee](http://blockee.org/), [JFDICitizen](http://codeforamerica.github.com/jfdicitizen/)

* **Go to where the people already are**: Facebook. Seriously, Facebook. They're on Facebook.

* **Improve an existing process/activity**: official adoption or replacement of existing resource. You may need to invest more time in social processes (explaining, building trust, gaining buy-in) than engineering.

* **It alerts you**: There are very few websites that people will visit on a regular basis, so what would _you_ want to be told about.

* **Civic Wayfinding**: have a clear "now what" action step. Show people where to put their logical or emotional response: write their reps, letter to the editor, send story to local blog, etc. Instead of trying bulldoze through the walls of bureaucracy, hold people's hand in going up, over, or around them. Take them on a bear hunt:

    > We're going on a bear hunt,
    > We're gonna catch a big one,
    > What a beautiful day,
    > We're not scared.
    > Oh oh!
    > A river,
    > A deep, cold river.
    > We can't go over it,
    > We can't go under it,
    > We've gotta go throught it!
    > Splish splosh, splish splosh.

## Idea Patterns
* **A business model**: Even as a thought experiment, asking “who would pay money for this and how much?” can crystallize intent

* **Use it yourself**: Like everyday, consistently.

* **Relevance**: Is the app doing something that matters to people in the field? For example, is it tracking things that matter to the people who are tracking them?  (see "Tracking stuff that only matters to management")

* **Bridging tech capacity**: Is it doing something that the people who should make it cannot do for time, money, skill reasons? Maybe they already have tech capacity to do 90% of stuff, but just need help getting data out of the system, etc.

## Design _Anti_-Patterns

* **Civic CMS**: the boringest interaction model ever. 

    > “Liberty cannot be established without content, nor content without content moderation.” 
    > <br><cite>– de Tocquiville</cite> 

* **..and it has SMS**: we all know SMS is code for _those people_. If your conception of the experience of poverty, economic or social marginalization is "doesn't own smartphone", your app isn't serving real needs or context.

* **Stuff on a map**: [put a bird on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XM3vWJmpfo) and call it a day.

* **Remove humans from the process**

* **Games that aren't actually games**: Zynga "badge acquisition" isn't actually "fun” despite being a “game”, it's just addictive.

* **Niche tools**: from ReportingOn's [farewell blogpost](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2010/12/lessons-learned-from-reportingon363.html) about building highly specialized tools for journalists (and applicable to just about any domain, like civic tech): 

    > Unless what you're building meets a _very_ journalism-specific need, you're probably grinding your gears to build something "for journalists" when they just need a great communication tool, independent of any particular niche or category of users.

## Idea _Anti_-Patterns

* **Negative Feedback**: Crime maps, restaurant inspections, waste/fraud/abuse.
    Example: [Don'tEat.At](http://donteat.at/)

* **"Imagine a million users…"**: No, imagine one user (hopefully you); what's the immediate benefit to user #2?

* **They'll find it via Google / if we build it they will come**: Nope. They won’t. 

* **And then they will tell their friends…**: Nope. They won’t do that either, especially if "they" never came in the first place (see "if we built it they will come"). 

* **“It’s interesting” / Pseudo Investigative Journalism**: If it doesn’t have an action step, so what? 

* **Tracking stuff that only matters to management**: Ok, so you now you have a great user roles, permissions and auditing system; how does that make it easier for the people actually accessing and entering data into the system?

* **No competition scan**: ch

* **It's for the little people**: Not something the user wants to do, but something *you* want the user to do
You want people to collaborate better, but do *they* want to collaborate better, or more importantly, are they willing to invest in the collaboration


* **It's in the algorithm / it's an engineering problem**: 

* **They’ll visit it all the time**: yep, Google, Facebook, the New York Times and your app.

## Types of Civic Applications

The following is taken from [ESRI's "Civic Engagement Apps Fall into Seven Categories"](http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0312/civic-engagement-apps-fall-into-seven-categories.html) [though it could use improvement]:

* **Public Information:** Maps are being used with greater frequency to communicate complex information that would not be quickly grasped in another format. These apps are effective at addressing transparency concerns, provide a channel for feedback, and communicate both where and why government money is being spent. Recovery.org, mapping the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act economic stimulus spending, is a good example of this type of app.

* **Public Reporting:** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tapped into the power of crowdsourced information through the FCC Speed Test, an iPhone app that measures the quality and speed of a consumer's broadband connection. During the first six months it was available from the App Store, 1.2 million people downloaded the app and reported back information that helped the agency plan infrastructure expansion and determine policy. The captured data is visualized as a mapped surface that can be explored.

* **Solicited Comments**: Apps don't have to be forever. When the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County, Nevada, wanted citizen comment on the Reno Sparks Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan, it worked with Esri partner CitySourced to develop an app that would let residents identify the locations for needed improvements, such as a crosswalk or a bike lane, simply by taking a photo of the location with a smartphone and writing comments in a form. These comments were captured and displayed on a web map. The app went up in summer 2010 and was taken down in early 2011.

* **Unsolicited Comments**: Governments can learn about public opinion on issues and the effects of events through apps that gather constituents' posts on social media sites such as Twitter and Flickr. Social media maps on events such as the Gulf of Mexico oil spill aggregated and shared comments, photos, and videos that greatly enhanced the information available on conditions.

* **Citizen as Sensor**: The Crime Tips app, from Esri partners The Omega Group and CitySourced, gives police many more eyes on the street. The iPhone/iPod/iPad app lets the user learn which crimes are happening nearby as well as anonymously report crime tips that will be forwarded to authorities.

* **Volunteerism**: The Lifesaving App for the Android and iPhone, developed for the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District by the nonprofit PulsePoint Foundation, crowdsources Good Samaritans. In instances of cardiac arrest, time is vital. The Lifesaving App lets smartphone users volunteer to be notified if someone nearby needs CPR. When a 911 call is received, the nearest CPR volunteer, who is in the best position to respond in timely fashion, receives information on the incident.

* **Citizen as Scientist**: Individuals can contribute to collective knowledge with these apps. The free Mojave Desert Tortoise app lets users take a photo, find out more about this endangered species, and note location and other information about an individual tortoise.
